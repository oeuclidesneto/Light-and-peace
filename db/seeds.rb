  service.full_description ="According to Spiritism, diseases and imbalances originate in the spiritual body, also known as the perispirit, which is the subtle envelope that connects the spirit to the physical body. According to the teachings of Allan Kardec and other Spiritist authors, physical ailments often reflect disturbances in the spiritual body, which in turn can be influenced by negative thoughts, emotions, and unbalanced behaviors of the individual. When the perispirit is misaligned or out of balance due to negative feelings, past traumas, or wrongful actions, these imbalances can manifest in the physical body, resulting in illnesses or emotional problems. Additionally, the perispirit can be influenced by spiritual entities, which may act either positively or negatively, depending on the individualâ€™s spiritual and moral state. Energy Healing is directly connected to this concept. In Energy Healing, the medium, with the help of higher spirits, transmits healing energy that works on the individualâ€™s perispirit, promoting harmonization and restoring spiritual balance. As the perispirit is the link between the physical body and the spirit, balancing it can help improve the emotional and physical state of the person, preventing or alleviating symptoms that have their origins in spiritual disharmony. Thus, Energy Healing is a tool to restore energetic and spiritual balance, which in turn positively affects the individual's physical and emotional health."
