  <!-- Section: What is Spiritism -->
  <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-md">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-950 mb-4">What is Spiritism?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">
      Spiritism is a philosophical, scientific, and religious doctrine founded by Allan Kardec in the 19th century, based on the study and understanding of spiritual reality. The doctrine explains the origin, nature, and destiny of spirits and the laws that govern the spiritual world.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      Spiritism promotes inner transformation, the practice of moral principles such as charity and love, and the evolution of the soul through reflection and reincarnation.

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      The Spiritist Doctrine originated in 19th-century France through the work of Allan Kardec, a respected educator and scientist. In 1857, he published “The Book of Spirits”, launching the movement. His scientific and moral approach shaped the development of Spiritism, later expanded by complementary works and spreading globally—especially in Brazil.
